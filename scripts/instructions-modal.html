You then move the player that you are suggesting to that room with you. You must also suggest a weapon.&nbsp;<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Falsifying a Suggestion</span></strong><br />After a player has made a suggestion, the other players have the goal of disproving the suggestion. This starts with the player whose turn it is next. If they have a card in their hand that can disprove the suggestion, they share it with the person who made the suggestion. If that person can&rsquo;t disprove the suggestion, then the next person tries to disprove it. This continues until one person can disprove the suggestion or everyone has had the chance to. If a player can disprove the suggestion with more than one card, they only share one card. It is important to remember that the player you control could also be the criminal.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Making an Accusation</span></strong></div>

<div id=":rm.ma" class="Mu SP">
    <div id=":rm.at" class="xH">Players are only allowed one accusation per game. An accusation can be made at any time during a players turn. Accusations are different than suggestions in that they don&rsquo;t move players and other players do not disprove the accusation. After the accusation is made, the player who made the accusation will see the solution set. If they are correct than the game is over, if they are wrong then they no longer make any moves. There only roll going forward in the game will be to disprove suggestions using the cards in their hand.</div>
